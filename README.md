Matrix
A Python class that implements basic matrix operations.

Description
This class allows you to create and manipulate matrices of any size and perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It also provides a nice string representation of the matrices.

Installation
To use this class, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [here]. You donâ€™t need any additional packages or libraries.

Usage
To use this class, you need to import it in your Python script. For example:

from matrix import Matrix

# create a 2x2 matrix with default values of 0
m1 = Matrix.create_matrix(2, 2, 0)

# create a 2x2 matrix by entering the values manually
m2 = Matrix.create_matrix(2, 2)

# print the matrices
print(m1)
print(m2)

# perform some operations
m3 = m1 + m2 # add the matrices
m4 = m1 - m2 # subtract the matrices
m5 = m1 * m2 # multiply the matrices element-wise
m6 = m1 / m2 # divide the matrices element-wise
m7 = m1 ** m2 # raise the matrices element-wise to the power of the other matrix

# print the results
print(m3)
print(m4)
print(m5)
print(m6)
print(m7)
